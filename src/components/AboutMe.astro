  <h2 class="section--heading">About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a front end web developer currently working at <a
      href="https://shelter.org.uk">Shelter</a
    > and living in Bristol. I graduated from the University of Gloucestershire in
    2019 with a degree in Computing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy creating websites as a way to combine technical and creative skills;
    any projects shown here are either university work, or have been completed
    in my free time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time I enjoy listening to music, watching football, and drinking
    cider.
