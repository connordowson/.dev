      <h1>Uses</h1>

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> as my
          editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The theme I use is <a href="https://citylights.xyz/">City Lights</a>,
          it's a nice dark theme and is the one you see on this website on any
          code snippets.
        </li>
        <li>
          I use <a href="https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/"
            >Berkeley Mono</a
          > from Berkeley Graphics, well worth the Â£60 it cost in my eyes, even
          if my friends make fun of me for spending that much on a font.
        </li>
        <li>Windows terminal with zsh, by using WSL on Windows 11.</li>
        <li>
          For note taking and brainstorming I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/"
            >Obsidian</a
          > which uses markdown and is linked up to my Google Drive so I can
          access my notes from anywhere.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I built my own PC - it has an AMD Ryzen 5600X, 32GB RAM, and somehow
          my GTX 970 is still chugging along ðŸ˜±.
        </li>
        <li>
          My keyboard is a Corsair K70 which I'm using until all the parts
          arrive for a custom keyboard I'm going to build.
        </li>
      </ul>
