  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="flow prose relative">
    <p>
      A senior front end web developer currently working at <a
        href="https://shelter.org.uk">Shelter</a
      > and living in Bristol. I graduated from the University of Gloucestershire
      in 2019 with a degree in Computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy creating websites as a way to combine technical and creative
      skills - any projects shown here are either university work, or have been
      completed in my free time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy listening to music 🎵, watching football (I'm a
      Bristol City season ticket holder) ⚽, and drinking cider 🍻.
