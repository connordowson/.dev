The portfolio you're on right now! Created with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), and hosted on Netlify, using a Netlify serverless function to display my Spotify top tracks.

<!-- This portfolio is created using Astro as a static site generator, markdown to write the project cards and blog posts, and is hosted on Netlify. I've used a Netlify serverless function to be able to display what songs I've been listening to recently on Spotify. -->
